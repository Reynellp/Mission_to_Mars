# Mission_to_Mars

## Background
Robin is now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project for the mission to Mars.

Assisting Robin scrape, organize, analyze, and visualize the data. As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

## Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars NASA news site Links to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website
3. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures
4. Store all the dictionaries in a Python list
5. Printed the list in the notebook

## Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data
1. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site Links to an external site.. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table. 
3. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
4. Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. Converted the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.
5. Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions
